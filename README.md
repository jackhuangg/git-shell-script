# git-shell-script

Shell script created to make committing onto github quicker.

## How to use

Download both files: 
- gitsetup.sh is for making the initial commit and linking the directory to your github repository
- gitcommit.sh is for making quick commits to a branch

Place both files in your current working directory
- run using command ./gitsetup.sh or ./gitcommit.sh

OR

Place both files in your Users folder
- run using command ~/gitsetup.sh or ~/gitcommit.sh

To reach your Users folder, open your Documents folder, then press option + command + up-arrow-key, and drag and drop the files there.

### Disclaimer

The lack of features is because I am currently only using git for pushing code to my personal repositories. Later on, I will add more options to these shell scripts.
