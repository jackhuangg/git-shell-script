# git-shell-script

Shell script created to make committing onto github quicker.

## How to use

Download both files: 
- gitsetup.sh is for making the initial commit and linking the directory to your github repository
- gitcommit.sh is for making quick commits to a branch

Place both files either in the working directory or in your Users folder on Mac. The benefit to doing this is you can run these scripts from any directory on your computer.

To reach your Users folder, open your Documents folder, then press option + command + up-arrow-key, and drag and drop the files there.
